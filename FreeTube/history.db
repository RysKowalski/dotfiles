Join me on a tour of hyperspace, and see the many strange creatures that live there. They are just functions with lots of inputs and outputs. They are parametric surfaces that take inputs u and v, and output spatial x,y,z coordinates, and r,g,b,a color outputs. This produces a colored 3d surface. Then you can add additional inputs and visualize a single slice of each input parameter, and slide through different parameter values to see different slices of the function over time. This causes the colored surface to evolve over time.\nI take my time to build up the mathematical intuitions behind visualizing functions, starting with 1-in-1-out functions, and pushing it up to 7-in-7-out functions, and beyond.\n\nEnter Hyperspace: https://evolvecode.io/hyperspace/index.html\nSource Code: https://github.com/MaxRobinsonTheGreat/hyperdimensions\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/tnjmrmprQs\n\n~SUPPORT ME~\nScrimba: https://scrimba.com/?via=EmergentGarden\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/emergentgarden\nKo-fi: https://ko-fi.com/emergentgarden\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/max_romana\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/emergentgarden.bsky.social\n\n~SOURCES~\nFunctions Describe the World: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHU1xH6Ogs4&t=61s\nHyperspace animation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ga4IICXyCE\nShell Surfaces: https://www.geogebra.org/m/twfwsxb9\n\nMusic: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIhjfe2-Xdjtp7LoqVLIcaA\nMost come from this new album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx5DtYiJ2DI\n\nAI Disclaimer: \nI used AI code tools for the website and animations.\nNo AI video, images, script, voice, or music were used.\n\n~TIMESTAMPS~\n(0:00) Functions in Hyperspace\n(2:47) Visualizing Functions\n(5:37) Parametric Surfaces\n(10:01) Slices of Slices\n(14:55) More Parameters\n(18:28) Exploring the Zoo","viewCount":166227,"lengthSeconds":1463,"watchProgress":0.510278,"timeWatched":1767050947601,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"KOqJMOsKXX7szqR7","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}
